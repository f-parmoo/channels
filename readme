    I designed one API with post method, we can pass Metrics, breakdowns, Sorting and Filters to this unique API and get the result as a json

Common API use-cases:

    body JSON:
        {
            "metrics" :["impressions","clicks"],
            "breakdowns" : ["channel","country"],
            "sorting": [{"name":"clicks", "type":"desc"}],
            "filters":[{"name":"date_to","value":"2017-05-31"}]
